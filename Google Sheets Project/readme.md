## Project Objectives
In this project, we’ll investigate access to safe and affordable drinking water focussing on inequalities in services levels between different countries and regions.

## There are two parts to this integrated project. You need to import and clean data, create new features and visualisations, interpret the results, and answer the multiple-choice questions.

## In part one, we’ll answer questions like:
- How do the world population estimates compare to the provided dataset populations?
- How does the urban population share compare to the rural population?
- What is the tendency and spread of the different water access features?
- How do these measures of water access compare across different types of areas?
- What does the national access to water look like based on national population size?
- What does the urban access to water look like based on urban population size?
- What does the rural access look like?
- What is the effect of national population size and urbanisation on GNI and water access?

## In part two, we’ll answer questions like:
- How does the imported dataset differ from the Estimates on the use of water (2020) dataset? 
- Which years are represented within the dataset?
- What is the average year difference per country? 
- What is the Annual Rates Change (ARC) for the national, rural, and urban areas per country?
- What is the average of the different ARCs for all countries?
- How does access to basic water change over time for different areas?
- How does the ARC differ between rural and urban populations?
- How does the ARC compare across different regions?
- How does the national population size influence the ARC?

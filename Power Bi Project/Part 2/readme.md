In this second part of the integrated project, we focus on data models. Weâ€™ll import tables separately, clean data, and set up a working relational data model in PowerBI. We will also recreate our visuals with the new data model, and see how the new model affected our visuals. Our goal is to refine the visuals, customising text, colours, and fonts to make the visuals clear and simple.
